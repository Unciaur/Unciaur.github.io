<h1>Heya!</h1>
<p>It seems that you've reached a very random place.</p>
<p>If you're here, you're also not supposed to be here!</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>You're here now anyways.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem like there's a lot of things I can do about this...</p>
<h2>This is really where I go place random useless stuff whilst learning how to code.</h2>
<p>You're welcome to watch.</p>
<p>Not gonna do much harm hopefully at least.</p>
